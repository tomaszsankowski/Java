# OOP Virtual World

This is a comprehensive Object-Oriented Programming project in Java. It implements a Virtual World simulation game with a Swing GUI, featuring various animals and plants interacting on a grid.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design:** Utilizes inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to model the world, organisms, animals, and plants.
- **Swing GUI:** Provides a graphical user interface for visualizing the simulation, including a grid board and controls for adjusting parameters (e.g., board size).
- **Organism Interactions:** Implements complex interactions between different species, such as predation, reproduction, and special abilities (e.g., `BarszczSosnowskiego`, `Guarana`).
- **Turn-Based Simulation:** The world evolves in discrete turns, with each organism taking actions based on its specific rules and attributes.

## How to Run

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
2. Ensure the project is configured as a standard Java application (no Maven required).
3. Run the `Main` class located in `src/Main.java`.
4. Use the GUI controls to set up the simulation parameters and start the game.
