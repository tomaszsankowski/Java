# Lab 5: JUnit and Mockito

This mini-project focuses on unit testing in Java using the JUnit framework and the Mockito mocking library.

## Features

- **Unit Testing:** Writing test cases for individual components (`MageController`, `MageRepository`) using JUnit.
- **Mocking Dependencies:** Using Mockito to create mock objects for dependencies, isolating the unit under test.
- **Test Coverage:** Demonstrates testing various scenarios, including successful operations and error handling.

## How to Run

1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Navigate to the `src/test/java/org/example/` directory.
3. Run the test classes (`MageControllerTest.java`, `MageRepositoryTest.java`) using your IDE's test runner or via Maven (`mvn test`).
4. Review the test results and coverage in the console or IDE test panel.
