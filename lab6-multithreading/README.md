# Lab 6: Multi-threading in Java

This mini-project explores further multi-threading concepts in Java, including the Producer-Consumer problem and caching mechanisms.

## Features

- **Producer-Consumer Problem:** Implements a classic synchronization problem using a shared `Warehouse` and multiple `Producer` and `Consumer` threads.
- **Caching Mechanism:** Demonstrates caching prime numbers using a `CachingPrimeChecker` class to improve performance.
- **Thread Synchronization:** Uses `wait()`, `notify()`, and `synchronized` blocks to manage access to shared resources.

## How to Run

1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Navigate to the `src/main/java/zad1/` or `src/main/java/zad2/` directory.
3. Run the `Main` class in either directory to see the respective multi-threading example in action.
4. Observe the console output to understand the concurrent execution and synchronization.

## Technologies

- Java
- Maven
- Java Concurrency (`java.util.concurrent`)
