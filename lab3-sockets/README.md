# Lab 3: Sockets

This mini-project covers network programming in Java using Sockets. It includes implementations for both TCP and UDP communication protocols.

## Features

- **TCP Client-Server:** Reliable, connection-oriented communication using `Socket` and `ServerSocket`.
- **UDP Client-Server:** Connectionless communication using `DatagramSocket` and `DatagramPacket`.
- **Message Object:** Demonstrates sending and receiving serialized objects (`Message.java`) over the network.

## How to Run

1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Start the server first by running `Server.java` or `UDPServer.java`.
3. Start the client by running `Client.java` or `UDPClient.java`.
4. Observe the communication between the client and server in the console.

## Technologies

- Java
- Maven
- Java Networking API (`java.net`)
