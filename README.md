# Java Projects Repository

This repository serves as an archive for my Java mini-projects and university laboratory assignments. The projects cover a wide range of topics, from core language features to multi-threading, networking, and object-relational mapping.

## Projects Overview

| Project | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**lab1-collections**](./lab1-collections) | Introduction to Java Collections Framework using `HashSet` and `TreeSet` with custom sorting. |
| [**lab2-threads**](./lab2-threads) | Basic multi-threading examples, including concurrent execution and prime number calculations. |
| [**lab3-sockets**](./lab3-sockets) | Network programming using Java Sockets, covering both TCP and UDP client-server protocols. |
| [**lab4-hibernate-h2**](./lab4-hibernate-h2) | Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) using Hibernate and JPA with an H2 in-memory database. |
| [**lab5-junit-mockito**](./lab5-junit-mockito) | Unit testing in Java using JUnit and Mockito for dependency mocking. |
| [**lab6-multithreading**](./lab6-multithreading) | Advanced concepts: Producer-Consumer problem and caching mechanisms. |
| [**lab6-image-processing**](./lab6-image-processing) | Parallel processing using `ForkJoinPool` and Java Streams for image manipulation. |
| [**oop-virtual-world**](./oop-virtual-world) | Comprehensive OOP project: Virtual World simulation with a Swing GUI. |

## Setup and Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher (JDK 11+ recommended).
- **Build Tool**: Most projects are managed via **Maven** (`pom.xml`).
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.

## How to Run

1. **For Maven projects**: Navigate to the folder, run `mvn clean install`, and execute the `Main` class.
2. **For standard projects**: Open in IDE and run the `Main.java` file.
